### Extract, Transform, and Load Data ###

We partnered up to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and extracted and transformed (cleaned) the data. 
After we transformed the data, we created four CSV files (found in Resources folder) and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema(found in Results folder. 
Lastly, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
